Network module for Go (UDP broadcast + QUIC p2p connections)
==========================================

See [`example/main.go`](example/main.go) for usage example.

Features
--------

Channel-in/channel-out pairs of (almost) any custom or built-in data type can be supplied to a pair of transmitter/receiver functions. Data sent to the transmitter function is automatically serialized and broadcast on the specified port. Any messages received on the receiver's port are de-serialized (as long as they match any of the receiver's supplied channel data types) and sent on the corresponding channel. See [bcast.Transmitter and bcast.Receiver](network/bcast/bcast.go).

Peers on the local network can be detected by supplying your own ID to a transmitter and receiving peer updates (new, current, and lost peers) from the receiver. See [peers.Transmitter and peers.Receiver](network/peers/peers.go).

Finding your own local IP address can be done with the [LocalIP](network/localip/localip.go) convenience function, but only when you are connected to the internet.

QUIC extension:
P2P connections using QUIC. Setting up a connection is done using the listener and sender structs. There's also a small packet loss script included as the provided one seems quite dysfunctional.

See example/main.go for a use case example

Note that all changes from the original Network-go module are in transferQUIC.go and main.go
