Here is some general information about the code:

Our code uses TCP, and a peer to peer system.
The elevators can share their orders, and the best elevator takes it, though this algorithm is not yet optimal.

The code uses a priority_value to decide which elevator which should take the order. This algorithm is not very good right now, 
as it only finds the distance between the floor and buttons. In this part there are a lot of commented out code, which didn't run as
intended.

The code can be run by writing:

go run main.go -id X
