# Elevator-Lab

How the elevator-code works:

All the code is in package main, but seperated in to several files for convenience.
We have files for the code relevant for the fsm, request handling and door timing.

There are certain improvements with the code being more uniform and following convention, but we have tried to follow the convention.

There are probably other stuff, more technical that could also be better, so we are looking forward to feedback.
